# Fabric-defect-Detection
## Introduction
There are different applications of computer vision and digital image processing in various applied domains and automated production process. In textile industry, fabric defect detection is considered as a challenging task as the quality and the price of any textile product are dependent on the efficiency and effectiveness of the automatic defect detection. Previously, manual human efforts are applied in textile industry to detect the defects in the fabric production process. Lack of concentration, human fatigue, and time consumption are the main drawbacks associated with the manual fabric defect detection process. Applications based on computer vision and digital image processing can address the abovementioned limitations and drawbacks.
## Segmentation based approaches
Segmentation is used to divide the image into subregions, and the success of any computer vision algorithm depends on the effectiveness of the applied segmentation technique . The high computational cost associated with image segmentation is considered as one of the limitations of approaches that are relying on image segmentation.To detect defects in plain woven fabrics investigated an approach based on the segmentation of regions of interest (ROI) from defected images. The processing is done by using images in grayscale mode, and an image enhancement technique is applied to highlight the regions with defects. To further enhance the accuracy and to reduce the algorithm complexity, the noise is removed by applying the low-pass filtering which highlights the defected regions. The defected regions are then segmented with edge detection based on first-order derivatives. The Roberts operator was observed to efficiently detect the edge of defect regions and resulted in better accuracy. The ROIs are then obtained by isolating the defect regions based on boundary. The experimental results demonstrated that segmentation of defective regions was done successfully which enhanced the defect detection rate.
## Fabric Image Preprocessing
### A. Grayscale Conversion
The original plain woven fabric image is the three channel RGB image which is not suitable for efficient digital image processing. Therefore, the original RGB image should be converted to single channel grayscale image. There are several methods for the conversion, such as mean value, maximum value and weighted average. 
### B. Enhancement
Compared with the image background, the defect images of plain woven fabric, especially those of end out, double end and double pick, are blurred and difficult to identify. From the histograms corresponding to the grayscale plain woven fabric images, it can be found out that the gray values of the images are distributed in a limited scope which is not conducive to image analysis and processing. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of plain woven fabric defect detection, image enhancement, which expands the difference between the defect area and the background, is needed to highlight the defect area.
### C. Filtering
For computer image processing and analysis system, a clear and noiseless image can not only reduce the complexity of image processing and analysis algorithm in the system, but also ensure the accuracy of image processing and analysis. However, due to the influence of the working environment on the plain woven fabric production line and the factors of the image acquisition system itself, some noises will be mixed into the image in the process of acquisition and transmission. The existences of noises and background make the segmentation of the defect more difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to study the corresponding filtering methods to remove or weaken the influence of noises and background in the image 
## Automatic Defect Segmentation
### A. Edge Detection
Image segmentation is an important basis of image analysis. It is necessary to segment the preprocessed plain woven fabric image, locate the desired defect area, and extract the complete defect area from the image background for analysis. According to the characteristics of plain woven fabric defect images, different edge detection methods are compared to choose the most suitable one for segmentation. Roberts operator is finally chosen as the edge detection operator for segmentation.
